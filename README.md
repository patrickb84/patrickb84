# Hello there 👋

_Skip to the [haiku](#%EF%B8%8F-haiku)_

## 🍀 I'm Patrick  

🧑‍💻 I am a Software Engineer specializing in **Front End Web and Mobile Development**. I have been working in the industry since 2018. 

👨‍🎓 While I've been working I've also pursued an education at Salt Lake Community College and Western Governor's University where I earned a **Bachelor's Degree in Software Development** in 2022. 

🌐 I started out as a Software Engineer in a small agency that specialized in .NET. I was very interested in working for clients and managed to work on a UI project for a solar company, using the LAMP stack. Soon after that, I was working for a startup, building several projects and tools in React, React Native, and Firebase. **I have spent most of my career in the .NET stack or involved in React projects.** I have worked in office in Utah, Oregon, and remotely with people from Romania and Argentina. 

🔭 Currently, I am working on upping my **VueJS and cloud** skills. 

🌱 I am very interested in learning more about AI, LLM's and image (art) generation. 

🐣 Outside of work, we recently had a daughter and she is my world! 

👨‍🎤 I consider myself an artist and musician. I have been drawing all my life and have been playing guitar and writing songs since 2000. I am still working on my masterpiece. I like any song that makes me sing or is nice to drive to. I am also learning how to dance disco and country line. I like to write short stories that are cerebral. My hobbies have _range_ baby. 

🏝️ I grew up in the Philippines and can speak Tagalog/Filipino. When we moved to the US I lived on an island in the Puget Sound. **I am island people.**
